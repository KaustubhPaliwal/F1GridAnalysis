    "Formula 1 (F1) is a premier motorsports competition where the world’s top drivers and automotive manufacturers compete across a series of races on diverse tracks worldwide, vying for the championship title. The starting grid position for each driver is determined in a Saturday qualifying session held the day before the race. Starting grid position in Formula 1 (F1) undoubtedly affects the likelihood of winning a race. Common sense would indicate that starting in pole (first) position would give you the highest likelihood to win the race. Since overtaking is a challenging task that can be amplified on certain circuits, starting in a higher grid position provides a large advantage over lower positions.\n",

    "We hypothesize that the likelihood of winning a race is highest for drivers who start in the top two (or front row) grid positions and maintain the lead after the first lap, especially on circuits with restricted overtaking opportunities, like Monaco or the Hungaroring. Specifically, we expect that starting grid position, first-lap lead status, and circuit type (street vs. traditional) will interact to shape race outcomes: drivers in the front row will have a significant advantage on overtaking-limited circuits, whereas on high-speed circuits with more overtaking zones, the impact of starting position may be reduced, making the first-lap lead a more dynamic variable. Additionally, we predict that weather conditions (such as rain) will further amplify the advantage of starting in a top position or leading after the first lap, as difficult conditions make it challenging for those starting further back to gain positions."

Based on this, we can pretty confidently say there is no bias as the sole type of data is recorded racing data. However, before working on our problem, we will ensure that there is no bias involved in the dataset based on team or driver. Using that, we can try to eliminate team and driver bias, allowing us to make objective conclusions.\n",
